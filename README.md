**Reinforcement Learning** is a framework where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.

1)At each time step, the agent observes the state of the environment, 2) A neural policy (deep neural network) maps the state to an action (Deep Reinforcement Learning), 3) The environment responds with a reward and a new state, 4) The agentâ€™s objective is to maximize cumulative reward over time.

**Key Algorithms:**

Policy Gradient Methods:

1) Simple Policy Gradient
2) Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)
3) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Actor-Critic Methods:

4) Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
5) Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
6) Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)



**Related Topics:**

1) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), 2) Imitation Learning
